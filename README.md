The Google Calendar API enables developers to integrate Google Calendar's features into applications. It supports creating, viewing, updating, and deleting events, managing calendars, setting reminders, and handling attendees. The API uses RESTful principles, supports various programming languages, and requires OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.
